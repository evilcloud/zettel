## What

A set of utilities for Zettelkasten, mostly around cleaning .md files and building schemas for different database formats. Currently supported:

- Pyvis (and by extension NetworkX could be added with no issues)
- graphXR
- Neo4j in the form of cypher commands

Also there is an awkward Obsidian reformatted.

## State

This is far from being even alpha. Missing:

- config
- testing
- maybe kill off Obsidian reformatting (it appears to have an adapter build-in now -- also, my solution is way too messy)

## Next

Further work is required to add meaningful data to connections, and this would be a result of systemic review of the Zettel format (probably add cypher at the bottom in a YAML or something)
